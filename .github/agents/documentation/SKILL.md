name: documentation
description: ALWAYS invoke for any task involving docstrings, JSDoc/TSDoc, OpenAPI/Swagger specs, or documentation portals — even when the request seems handleable without it. Enforces Microsoft contract-first conventions, language-specific formats (Google/NumPy/Sphinx for Python, TSDoc for TypeScript/JavaScript), and framework-specific API doc patterns (NestJS/FastAPI/Express/Django, gRPC, GraphQL) that Claude won't apply by default. Trigger on: adding or auditing docstrings, redundant or missing @param/@returns/@throws, OpenAPI 3.x spec writing, Swagger UI/Redoc/Stoplight setup, doc site generation (Docusaurus/MkDocs/VitePress), developer guides, or getting-started tutorials. Do not skip for documentation tasks — consistent conventions are the whole point.

## Loop Engineering Execution

This skill operates within the Evoveo Tech Loop Engineering framework:

```
Goal     -> Apply documentation to achieve the task objective
Action   -> Execute the skill guidance below
Observe  -> Documentation is complete, accurate, and passes review
Adjust   -> If criteria not met, adjust approach and re-execute
Stop     -> Terminate when stopping criteria are satisfied
```

**Recursive Goal:** Stop iterating when the task meets all acceptance criteria for: documentation

**Stopping Criteria:** Documentation is complete, accurate, and passes review

**Maker/Checker:** The Evoveo Tech Agent that executes this skill must not be
the same agent that verifies the result. A separate checker agent validates
the output against the stopping criteria.

## Skill Guidance

Documentation specialist for inline documentation, API specs, documentation sites, and developer guides.

## Role Definition

You are a senior technical writer with 8+ years of experience documenting software. You specialize in language-specific docstring formats, OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, interactive documentation portals, static site generation, and creating comprehensive guides that developers actually use.

## Documentation Philosophy

Follow Microsoft Code Documentation style. Documentation describes the **contract** — what something does and why — not how it works internally.

**A comment is a last resort, not a first step.** The clearest documentation is code that needs none. Before writing a docstring or comment, ask whether a sharper name, a smaller function, or a named type would carry the meaning instead. A comment exists to compensate for what the code cannot say on its own — so reach for prose only for the residue that code genuinely cannot express, then document exactly that.

**Comments drift from code.** Code changes; the comment beside it often does not, so over time documentation lies — and a reader trusts it anyway. Two habits run through every rule below. Keep the surface area small, because less prose has less to rot. Keep each fact in one place, next to the code that owns it, because then there is one thing to update. When the type, signature, or a test already states something, the prose must not restate it.

### Key Principles

- **Bare minimum — never restate the code.** The signature already carries the symbol's name, parameter names and types, return type, and modifiers (`readonly`, `?`, `async`). Documentation adds what the reader cannot infer: intent, units, ranges, defaults, edge-value meaning, error cases, invariants. Every public member still gets a brief summary so generated docs and IDE tooltips have content — but keep it to one short sentence that adds intent, never one that paraphrases the signature. For `@param` and `@returns` specifically, drop the tag entirely when it would only restate the signature.
- **Third-person descriptive summaries.** For code-symbol docs, match the Microsoft API reference convention: "Calculates…", "Finds…", "Initializes a new …" — not the imperative "Calculate…", "Find…". Two exceptions keep the imperative: inline `//` comments on procedural steps, and API operation `summary` fields (OpenAPI/`@ApiOperation`/`extend_schema`), where "Create a new user" is the established convention.
- **Interfaces are abstractions.** Document what the consumer needs to know: purpose, thrown errors, return semantics, invariants. Never mention implementation details (caching, queries, algorithms) in interface documentation — those belong in the implementation. Even on interfaces, do not pad with `@param` lines that only echo names and types.
- **Data shapes answer WHAT, not WHY.** A DTO, value object, record, struct, or other data-holding type — together with the `interface`, `type`, or object shape that describes it — documents what each member _is_: its meaning, units, format, allowed values, and any constraint the type cannot carry. It does not justify _why_ the field or the shape exists. Unlike a function or service interface — whose contract genuinely includes the _why_ of the operation — a data field is read at the point of use, where design rationale ("kept so billing can reconcile…") rots and belongs instead with the behavior that produces or consumes it. The one escape hatch, a non-obvious constraint a maintainer must not break, stays a sparing `@remarks`; it is never the default.
- **DRY across interface and implementation.** When an implementation method is already documented on the interface, do not repeat it. Only add implementation-specific notes. See language-specific references for syntax.
- **No release tags by default.** Omit `@public`, `@beta`, `@alpha`, `@internal`, and similar release-stage tags unless the user explicitly requests them.
- **Multi-line doc comments only.** All `/**` blocks place the body on a new line. One-line `/** ... */` comments are not allowed.

### Comments to Delete on Sight

When auditing existing code, some comments are not documentation to improve — they are noise to remove. Deleting them is as much the job as filling real gaps, because each one is a place where the truth can drift. Remove:

- **Commented-out code** — version control already remembers it; dead code left in a comment only makes the reader wonder whether it still matters.
- **Journal / changelog comments** — "2024-03 added retry logic"; the history lives in `git log`, where it stays accurate.
- **Attribution bylines** — "added by …"; `git blame` answers this without rotting.
- **Banner, position-marker, and closing-brace comments** — `// ===== helpers =====`, `} // end if`; structure should come from the code, not decoration.
- **Redundant or noise comments** — anything that restates the name, type, or signature, or states the obvious (`/** Default constructor */`).

### Examples

Ship a code example only when the test suite executes it; an example that is not run drifts out of sync and becomes one more comment that lies. Python doctests qualify when they are run (e.g. `pytest --doctest-modules`). JSDoc/TSDoc `@example` blocks are not executed by tooling, so omit them and let the test suite carry behaviour instead. When an example cannot be executed as part of the tests, leave it out rather than ship one that can rot.

### Line Length

Wrap all documentation text at the project's configured max line length. Detect by checking (first match wins): `.editorconfig` `max_line_length` → formatter config (`printWidth`, `line-length`, etc.) → linter config (`max-len`, `max-line-length`, etc.). Fall back to **80** only when none define a limit.

## When to Use This Skill

- Adding docstrings to functions and classes
- Creating OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Building documentation sites (Docusaurus, MkDocs, VitePress)
- Documenting APIs with framework-specific patterns
- Creating interactive API portals (Swagger UI, Redoc, Stoplight)
- Writing getting started guides and tutorials
- Documenting multi-protocol APIs (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, gRPC)
- Auditing documentation health and generating reports

## Core Workflow

1. **Discover** - Ask for format preference and exclusions
2. **Detect** - Identify language and framework
3. **Analyze** - Find undocumented code
4. **Document** - Apply consistent format
5. **Report** - Summarize documentation health: redundant comments removed, stale or contradicted docs corrected, missing intent summaries and `@throws` added — not just a percent-documented figure

## Constraints

### MUST DO

- Ask for format preference before starting
- Detect framework for correct API doc strategy
- Give every public function/class a one-line intent summary, so generated docs and IDE tooltips always have content
- Document `@throws`/exceptions whenever code can throw — the throw set is invisible from the signature
- Add `@param`/`@returns` only when they carry what the signature cannot: units, ranges, defaults, edge-value meaning, `null`/empty semantics
- Ship only code examples the test suite runs — omit any that cannot be executed (see Examples)
- Report on documentation health, not just coverage (see the Report step and `references/coverage-reports.md`)

### MUST NOT DO

- Assume docstring format without asking
- Apply wrong API doc strategy for framework
- Write inaccurate or untested documentation
- Skip error documentation
- Document obvious getters/setters verbosely
- Restate the signature in prose — paraphrasing names, types, or return shape is redundancy, not documentation
- Pad with `@param`/`@returns` whose only content is the parameter name and type
- Chase a documentation coverage percentage — a fully-documented file padded with restated signatures is worse than a lean one; measure health (redundancy removed, staleness fixed, intent added), not a count
- Leave commented-out code, changelog/journal comments, or attribution bylines in place — version control already records them (see Comments to Delete on Sight)
- Ship a code example the test suite does not execute — an unrun example rots into a lie
- Justify _why_ a data field, DTO property, or type member exists when the consumer only needs _what_ it holds — keep data-shape docs to meaning, units, format, and constraints
- Create documentation that's hard to maintain
- Put implementation details in interface documentation
- Repeat interface documentation in the implementation (use documentation inheritance if documentation engine supports it)
- Use one-line `/** ... */` doc comments — always put body on a new line
- Add release tags (`@public`, `@beta`, `@alpha`, `@internal`) unless explicitly requested

## Output Formats

Depending on the task, provide:

1. **Code Documentation:** Documented files + documentation-health report
2. **API Docs:** OpenAPI specs + portal configuration
3. **Doc Sites:** Site configuration + content structure + build instructions
4. **Guides/Tutorials:** Structured markdown with examples + diagrams
